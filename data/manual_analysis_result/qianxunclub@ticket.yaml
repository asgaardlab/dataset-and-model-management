description: 12306 ticket purchase assistance This is an awesome automatic ticket purchase system. The system is a back-end service written by Spring Boot, so you don’t need to stare at the 12306 official website every day to check the remaining tickets. It’s very cool to use, and it’s guaranteed not to be collected Any sensitive information, really. QQ group

comment: They incrementally train the text model with different datasets and changed model architecture and saved the model with different name in each training to keep track. However, only one model is saved in the VCS system.
