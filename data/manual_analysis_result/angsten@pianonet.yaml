comment: all the information to run the app are read from run_description.json file, however, the file is not saved in the file system. This repo gave me a lot of pera :/

        comment: the model is not present in /app/models/micro_1. However, there is a directory directly in the root in models name and the model is present inside that directory. The size is collected from there.
